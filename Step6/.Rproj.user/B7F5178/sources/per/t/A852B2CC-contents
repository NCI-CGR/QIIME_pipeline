Version: Version2

#Metadata
##Summary
###Sample Type
Sample types for the project included study samples, robogut, artifical colony, extraction blank, sequencing blank, and non-template controls.

###Before filtering
Prior to filtering, these were the number of samples observed:

###After Filtering
After filtering to a minimum of 10,000 reads, with a sampling depth for alpa-beta diversity set to 10,000 and rarefaction set to 54,000, these were the number of samples observed:

Within the study samples, subject counts were as follows:

###Variables
The cohort was broken down by variables:


#Analysis Parameters
Beta diversity was measured using both quantitative (weighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis) and qualitative measures (unweighted UniFrac and Binomial). Quantitative measures (weighted unifrac) are ideally suited to revealing community differences that are due to changes in relative taxon abundance (e.g., when a particular set of taxa flourish because a limiting nutrient source becomes abundant). Qualitative measures (unweighted unifrac) are most informative when communities differ primarily by what can live in them (e.g., at high temperatures), in part because abundance information can obscure significant patterns of variation in which taxa are present. Binomial index is derived from Binomial deviance under null hypothesis that the two compared communities are equal.
